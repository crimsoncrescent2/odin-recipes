        <h2>Description</h2>
        It is possible to make perfectly fluffy white rice on the stovetop. Sauteing the rice first helps keep the rice grains separate. Keeping the pot covered for the entire cooking time traps the steam which is necessary for properly cooking the rice, and is very important. The last 5 minutes off the heat allow the rice to finish in the residual steam, without burning the bottom.
